Teaching is a fun activity because it compels me to hunt for ways to explain complex topics in a simple way. The most exciting part of this process is sometimes, it results in a totally new perspective on a topic I've never thought of before. As an undergrad, I've been involved with majorly two teaching roles. 

# Teaching Assistant

I have been a teaching assistant(TA) for two undergrad first-year physics courses. As a TA, I conducted weekly tutorial sessions for a batch of 38 students to discuss problem sets. Apart from that, I evaluated answer scripts, conducted weekly tutorial quizzes and provided course-work related guidance to the students. The course materials for the two courses can be accessed using the links below

# Vriksh NGO Volunteer

Vriksh is a non-profit organization which provides free-of-cost coaching to under-privileged students for various competitive examinations like JEE Main, JEE Advanced, KVPY and Olympiads. I volunteered at Vriskh NGO to teach high school students several topics in Chemistry and Physics. Here are the links for the relevant course materials.
