## 1. Dark Energy Models <br/>
In 1930s Edwin Hubble showed that our universe is expanding. Till 1998 it was widely believed that this expansion of the universe would be eventually slowed down. This slowing down was attributed to the fact that the universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. But the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae in 1998 showed that the universe was expanding more slowly earlier in time than it is today. And contrary to the popular belief the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating. One of the explanations theorists have come up with is there is some strange kind of energy-fluid named as "Dark Energy" that fills the entire space. Dark Energy constributes around 70% to the total energy budget of the universe, still very less is known about its nature. I am currentl working on a project which involves studying the properties of various Dark Energy Models to understand the physical nature of Dark Energy.

## 2. 21-cm Cosmology <br/>
With the advent of several ground based and space based telescopes, we have been able to directly
observe the galaxies out to distances corresponding to a time when the Universe was a billion
years old. The detection of CMB in 1964 allowed us to probe the primordial universe when it was
just 40,000 years old. However when it comes to the observation of the era connecting the two
aforementioned periods, the picture still remains blurry. This middle era is possibly one of the
most interesting epochs in the evolution of the universe when the first stars and galaxies came into
existence. 21-cm Cosmology is an alternative
attempt to indirectly observe the first stars and galaxies using the 21-cm signal emitted by the
abundant neutral-H in the early universe. With the development of several recent attempts
like James Webb Space Telescope(JWST) to observe the universe at very high redshifts, the field
of 21-cm Cosmology becomes an exciting area where weâ€™ll get to test our theoretical predictions
against the observations and study the birth of first stars and galaxies. [Here](https://prakharbansal16.github.io/Projects/) you can find the details of a project in this direction on which I'm currently working. 
## 3. Gravitational Waves
In his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of Gravitational Waves(GWs) in 1916. GWs can be better understood by considering the analogy with Electromagnetic Waves. Just like an accelerating charge radiates EM waves, an accelerating (and anisotropic) mass emits energy in Gravitational Waves. The strongest GWs are produced by some of the most violent events in the universe, like Black Hole (or Neutron Star) Collisions or Supernovae Explosions. Apart from these Astrophysical sources, GWs can also be of cosmological origin, which were emitted at the end of inflation. These GWs are called Primordial GWs. I am primarily interested in studying the properties of GWs from various astrophysical sources and Primordial GWs. [Here](https://prakharbansal16.github.io/Projects/) you can find the details of a project I completed as part of the Gravitational Waves Astronomy course offered in the Autumn 2022 sem.
## 5. CMB Anisotropies and Polarisation
Till 3,40,000 years after the Big Bang, our universe was in an ionised state and all the photons from that era got scattered off due to a large number of free electrons. As the universe expanded and the temperature dropped, the free electrons and protons combined to form neutral atoms. This allowed photons to stream freely through the space as the number of free electrons dropped. These photons that propogate through the universe and reach us are referred to as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The temperature of this radiation is roughly uniform (~2.7K) across all directions with small anisotropies of the order 1 in $10^5$. These anisotropies are key to understand many puzzling problems about the early universe.The CMB also carry two modes of polarisations - E and B. I am pariculary interested in the study of the B mode as it contains signatures of the primordial gravitational waves which are very difficult to detect otherwise.
