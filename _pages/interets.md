## 1. Dark Energy Models <br/>
In 1930s Edwin Hubble showed that our universe is expanding. Till 1998 it was widely believed that this expansion of the universe would be eventually slowed down. This slowing down was attributed to the fact that the universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. But the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae in 1998 showed that the universe was expanding more slowly earlier in time than it is today. And contrary to the popular belief the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating.
