## 1. Dark Energy Models <br/>
In 1930s Edwin Hubble showed that our universe is expanding. Till 1998 it was widely believed that this expansion of the universe would be eventually slowed down. This slowing down was attributed to the fact that the universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. But the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae in 1998 showed that the universe was expanding more slowly earlier in time than it is today. And contrary to the popular belief the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating. One of the explanations theorists have come up with is there is some strange kind of energy-fluid named as "Dark Energy" that fills the entire space. Dark Energy constributes around 70% to the total energy budget of the universe, still very less is known about its nature. I am currentl working on a project which involves studying the properties of various Dark Energy Models to understand the physical nature of Dark Energy.

## 2. 21-cm Cosmology <br/>
With the advent of several ground based and space based telescopes, we have been able to directly
observe the galaxies out to distances corresponding to a time when the Universe was a billion
years old. The detection of CMB in 1964 allowed us to probe the primordial universe when it was
just 40,000 years old. However when it comes to the observation of the era connecting the two
aforementioned periods, the picture still remains blurry. This middle era is possibly one of the
most interesting epochs in the evolution of the universe when the first stars and galaxies came into
existence. 21-cm Cosmology is an alternative
attempt to indirectly observe the first stars and galaxies using the 21-cm signal emitted by the
abundant neutral-H in the early universe. With the development of several recent attempts
like James Webb Space Telescope(JWST) to observe the universe at very high redshifts, the field
of 21-cm Cosmology becomes an exciting area where weâ€™ll get to test our theoretical predictions
against the observations and study the birth of first stars and galaxies. [Here](https://prakharbansal16.github.io/Projects/) you can find the details of a project in this direction on which I'm currently working.
