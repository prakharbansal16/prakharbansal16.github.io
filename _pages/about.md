Hello there! I'm Prakhar, a third year undergraduate student at the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay. Owning to my inclination towards Physics I'm pursuing a Minor degree in Physics. Though, I'm interested in almost all aspects of the subject, my main pursuits are Astrophysics and Cosmology. Keep scrolling to find out more about my research interests. I'm also currently involved with a few projects in the above mentioned areas. You can find a detailed description of each one of them [here](/Projects/).

Apart from academics, I'm quite into Stand-Up Comedy.
