Hello there! I am Prakhar, a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. Owing to my inclination toward Physics, I am pursuing a Minor degree in Physics. Although I am interested in all aspects of the subject, my main pursuits are Astrophysics and Cosmology, leading to my involvement in several exciting projects. You can find a detailed description of each one of them [here](https://prakharbansal16.github.io/Projects/). Keep scrolling to find out more about my research interests.  
Apart from academics, I am into stand-up comedy! I love writing and performing jokes based on events happening in and around the world. If you are a comedy-savant like me, this genre is topical comedy. If you are not, I might just write a set on you! The picture you can see on your left is that of the Annual Standup Showcase, an event held in our college where I and seven other performers from the institute performed for a packed auditorium of almost 700 members.
# Research Interests
I love spending my time reading and thinking about problems in Astrophysics and Cosmology especially early universe Physics. A few specific areas about which I'm quite excited and look forward to work to are
  - [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)
  - [Reionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization)
  - [Inflation Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology))
  - [Gravitational Waves of Early Universe]()
  - [Particle Physics of Early Universe]()
  - [Milli Second Pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar#:~:text=Millisecond%20pulsars%20are%20thought%20to%20be%20related%20to,companion%20star%20that%20has%20overflowed%20its%20Roche%20lobe.)
