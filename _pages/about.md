Hello there! I'm Prakhar, a third year undergraduate student at the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay. Owning to my inclination towards Physics I'm pursuing a Minor degree in Physics. Though, I'm interested in almost all aspects of the subject, my main pursuits are Astrophysics and Cosmology. Keep scrolling to find out more about my research interests. I'm also currently involved with a few projects in the above mentioned areas. You can find a detailed description of each one of them [here](/Projects/).

Apart from academics, I'm quite into Stand-Up Comedy. I love writing and performing jokes based on events happening in and around the world. In technical terms, the genre falls under the category of topical comedy. The picture that you can see on your left is that of the Annual Standup Showcase, an event held in our college where me along with 7 other performers from the insti performed for a packed auditorium consisting of a crowd of approx 700 members.

# Research Interests
I love spending my time reading and thinking about problems in Astrophysics and Cosmology especially early universe Physics. A few specific areas about which I'm quite excited and look forward to work to are
  - [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)
  - [Reionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization)
  - [Inflation Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology))
  - [Gravitational Waves of Early Universe]()
  - [Particle Physics of Early Universe]()
  - [Milli Second Pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar#:~:text=Millisecond%20pulsars%20are%20thought%20to%20be%20related%20to,companion%20star%20that%20has%20overflowed%20its%20Roche%20lobe.)
